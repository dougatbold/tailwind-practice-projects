            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I

            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best—and most grueling—time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet
